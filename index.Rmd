# Feb 11 - Feb 17, 2019

## Progress Items

* Developed outline for eTool (Deliverable 2). 
* Output as pdf and added to project home page.

## Agenda Items

1. Discuss eTool outline.
2. Discuss consiering Deliverable 1 as completed. 

# Feb 4 - Feb 10, 2019

## Progress Items

* Made eTool dev repository private and sent Mimi receipt for 12 month subscription. Sent email alluding to who I would like to add as collaborators. They will need to create GitHub accounts to view, discussed in email to Ruth and Fatima.
* eTool dev repository set as private, however, I left the final report and progress reports repositories as public. There is nothing sensitive and the websites developed from these repositories are worth showing outsiders for accountability and to describe our work. 

## Agenda Items

1. I went through the equipment inventory from Ruth that she received from Biologic Solutions. It could be useful if these are in the actual Cameroon data, however, is this all the information they have about their equipment? Currently, there is nothing other than type, do they have service dates? Or perhaps this is just info they don't have? I would really like to know how specific their data is.
2. Discuss my email regarding adding those involved with the equipment maintenance project as collaborators on GitHub if not resolved already. 
3. **Good time to discuss SOW:** 
Deliverable 1 in SOW - *Support the review of existing Nigeria/Cameroon country data (Deliverable – data reviewed, interim report* - Due Date: December, 2018
    + I have reviewed and [reported](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/existing_lab_data_exploration.md) on the current state of the Nigeria data from the past laboratory assessment. 
    + I also have reached out to the Cameroon Team repeatedly, and have not had any success in obtaining their data. I understand that ASLM/IRESSEF/CDC will be meeting in Nigeria soon (perhaps even this week) where it is possible progress could be made on this front in person.
    + I would like to consider this deliverable fulfilled. Although, I would be happy to review their data if it is made accessible to me in the very near future. If we cannot obtain it during February I would like to close this deliverable and consider it completed.
4. Deliverable 2 in SOW - *Collaborate with and lead the IT Task Force to identify the best systems, processes and tools to meet the program goals (Deliverable – weekly calls with Task Force to support review of data and development of eTool; final list of eTool features outlined* - Due Date: February, 2019
    + We have consistently held weekly meetings and I have provided updates on progress. Ruth has been the most consistent attendee on the progress management side and I believe my progress has been swift and satisfactory.
    + There are a few more changes I plan to make to the eTool, however, I believe that the core functionality and layout is set. If it is agreed upon that the current tool is acceptable, I would like to begin creating an outline of eTool features and post this report to GitHub to satisfy this deliverable. 
    + Finalizing the eTool layout and working on the outline will allow me to begin developing metrics for a dashboard to support project and laboratory supervisors in assessing maintenance activities (part of SOW deliverable 3). 


# Jan 28 - Feb 3, 2019

## Progress Items

* eTool Updates - Added confirmation message once the user selects the update date button. This will inform them that they have altered the underlying equipment data. Additionally, I have added popup boxes to inform them they have altered the underlying data. 
* Updated the final report, specifically the R libraries section. 
* Reviewed contract deliverables. Worth discussing the current state (see agenda items). 

## Agenda Items

1. I received my first wire which includes the fees for subscriptions for GitHub and shinyapps.io. Other than those who have been included in the IT calls as well as the the larger equipment maintenance group, is there anyone else I should include on the access lists for these accounts? 
2. Discuss current layout of the tool. Really coming along nicely.
3. Deliverable 1 in SOW - *Support the review of existing Nigeria/Cameroon country data (Deliverable – data reviewed, interim report* - Due Date: December, 2018
    + I have reviewed and [reported](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/existing_lab_data_exploration.md) on the current state of the Nigeria data from the past laboratory assessment.

# Jan 21 - Jan 27, 2019

## Progress Items

* I was able to get the data behind the eTool (googlesheets) to update based on user input in the eTool. At first I had trouble reconciling the date formats of the dates from my original "fake" data with the new data added by the user. I was able to get things working correctly but my initial approach would have slowed the tool down too much even for demonstration purposes. I am re-worked my approach and now it is functioning correctly. The tool now includes core functionality either outlined in the contract or discussed during calls, namely it can:
    + Give a summary of the current state of the equipment
    + Allow the user to update equipment data - I'll have to play around with the eTool behavior but I think the user has to refresh the app for changes to be reflected.
    + The eTool will only show the most recent data for each piece of equipment, however the original data is retained in the underlying googlesheet, allowing for the development of equipment "life books."
* As a follow-up to an inquiry from Theresa, I created an example code that could send alerts via email alerting partners to examine the eTool - [See example](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/email_proof_of_concept.Rmd). R library used for this (blastula) can be found in the [final report](https://paceafenet.github.io/final_report/). Additionally, I created a pricing guide for row level security as well as report scheduling features in commercial software - priced out RStudio Connect, PBI, Tableau. Summary and slides sent to Theresa (Fatima and Ruth CC'd) - [See Slides](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/Quick%20Pricing%20Guide%20%E2%80%93%20analytics%20reporting%20tools.pptx). Did she get it? Might have gone to spam.

## Agenda Items

1. Follow-up on any action items from larger group meeting. Discuss the PowerPoint in the eTool repository (see link above).
2. Discuss the current state of the layout and the addition of 'reactive' events. 
3. Briefly discuss ONA thoughts.
4. Consider follow-up with Cameroon team for their data. Worth getting to add to report of current data state. Gives us good information for what we 'need' for the tool as well as completing one of the project deliverables.

# Jan 7, - Jan 13 + Jan 14, - Jan 20, 2019

## Progress Items

**Note:** Combined last week's progress with this week's since no one was on for the Wed IT call. 

* As a follow-up to an inquiry from Theresa, I created an example code that could send alerts via email alerting partners to examine the eTool. R library used for this (blastula) can be found in the [final report](https://paceafenet.github.io/final_report/). Additionally, I created a pricing guide for row level security as well as report scheduling features in commercial software - priced out RStudio Connect, PBI, Tableau. Summary and slides sent to Theresa (Fatima and Ruth CC'd). 
* Sent Invoice 2 for payment to Mimi. First invoice still in progress for payment.
* I changed the UI in app. First I added a couple ways to alter the underlying data and also condensed the interface layout. Still in progress to make sure it's working properly. Retains historical data as well. 
* Finalized initial layout of the tool including background colors, text color, and object. Functionality to edit data to come later. Added custom layout for mobile. Currently, I have hidden several charts that appear on the desktop app from the mobile app. Will plan to change the UI for mobile.
* Posted most up to date app to shinyapps.io. 
* Sent Ruth the [link](https://travis-shinin-spot.shinyapps.io/etool_dev/) to the app.
* Added eTool link to the project home page.
* Presented the current layout to the larger group for feedback.
* Read up on ONA document. Usable API and seems reasonable, the question would be WHO would take ownership in the field and be responsible for entering data?

## Agenda Items

1. Have not heard back from Mimi as of yet. Need feedback on invoice. 
2. Follow-up on any action items from larger group meeting. Discuss the PowerPoint in the eTool repository (see link above).
3. Discuss the current state of the layout and the addition of 'reactive' events. 
4. Briefly discuss ONA thoughts.
5. Consider follow-up with Cameroon team for their data. Worth getting to add to report of current data state. Gives us good information for what we 'need' for the tool as well as completing one of the project deliverables. 

# Dec 31, 2018 - Jan 6, 2019

## Progress Items
* Working on layout of eTool. Currently have a map, charts describing the current state of the data, as well as tables in a single layout. 
* Updated final report with additional libraries used in eTool development (DT and leaflet). 

## Agenda Items
1. Current state of invoice. Sent, 12/26, need feedback on format and payment to progress.
2. Discuss eTool current state. I have made significant progress, on the layout and functionality of the tool. I still need to add the ability to edit the data and have these changes captured in the app. However, the layout is coming along nicely.
If you are not accessing the meeting via a computer, here is a [link](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/screen%20grabs/eTool%20pic%20one%201_7_19.jpg) to a screen grab of the current layout.
3. See updates in the [Final Report](https://paceafenet.github.io/final_report/) for additional tools used during development.
4. Have reached out to Cameroon a few times, hoping to reconnect now that most people should be back from leave. 

# Dec 17 - Dec 30, 2018

## Progress Items

* During the Dec 18 call it was requested that in addition to the website version of the progress reports, I also make the report available as a pdf or word document if possible. It took a bit of figuring out, but I will now be asking Ruth to attach the most up to date version of the progress report as a pdf to each week's meeting invite as well as include the link to the progress report site. 
* Drafted and sent the first invoice for first five weeks of work.
* Finalized the Nigeria report. During the Dec 18 call it was also requested that I also summarize the service providers in the Nigerian assessment data. Note to Travis: Go to the [report](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/existing_lab_data_exploration.md) and summarize this additional table. 
* Began developing eTool application code based on fake data set. 

## Agenda Items
1. Discuss eTool layout. So far working on the map to show what labs need attention (discuss criteria), general layout scheme developed.
2. Discuss Nigeria report updates.

# Dec 3 - Dec 16, 2018

## Progress Items

* Reached out to Cameroon for in-country data
* Reached out to Mimi for clarification regarding invoicing procedures. Will await her response before upgrading current GitHub account to Developer version. 
* My plan is to use Google Sheets as the data source for the eTool, and use the eTool to edit the data in Google Sheets. I will use an approach similar to this [app](https://jennybc.shinyapps.io/10_read-write-private-sheet/) (code [here](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets/tree/master/inst/shiny-examples/10_read-write-private-sheet)). I have authenticated the project Google account using this approach and can access a toy data set I created in Google Sheets. 
* Added [Nigeria Data Report](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/existing_lab_data_exploration.md) to the project home page. A link to this report is included here and on the home page. A more aesthetically pleasing copy of the report has also been sent as an attachment ahead of this meeting. Full process and initial results contained in this report, major conclusions and questions resulting from these analyses included below in the agenda items.

## Agenda Items

1. Follow-up after initial exploration of Nigeria data.
* For more accurate location of lab equipment we would will need latitude and longitudes of labs, or at least more descriptive addresses. Geocoded existing addresses to limited success. 
* These data can be used for demonstration as they are now, but the eTool will be most useful with a complete inventory of equipment at each lab.
* Information initially identified as essential including calibration dates which could be used to identify when equipment is due for maintenance, calibration, or retirement is largely dependent on manufacturer specifications. From the data as it is currently, it would not be possible to identify when equipment should next be serviced. This point will require further discussion.

# Nov 22 - Dec 2, 2018

## Progress Items

* Created a project GitHub account and associated repositories. Currently there are three repositories; one that will contain all eTool development code, another that will host a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) for progress, and a third repository that will host a GitHub page for the project's [Final Report](https://paceafenet.github.io/final_report/).
* Created associated RProject file for each repository and made templates that will be used to populate the GitHub pages referenced above.
* Began writing the outline and portions of the Final Report page. This will be a living document that serves as a road map of how this project was completed.
* Began reviewing Nigeria data. 
* Created 'fake' equipment data should we be unable to obtain sufficient equipment data from the field.

## Agenda Items

1. It is important that I store all code and progress reports using GitHub both for accountability and to facilitate reproduction of this project in the future. It is worth considering what should be kept in the repository. For example, the data I receive from Nigeria and Cameroon in country partners may include information we would not want to be accessible in GitHub.
  * Comments on the GitHub Pages layout?
  * Thoughts on where to store in country data?
2. Lab-level Metrics for evaluation;
  * Equipment up time vs downtime
  * Avg number of equipment past due for repair or servicing
  * Elapsed time after past due 
  * What are acceptable levels for the above?
3. Nigeria Data: Quite a bit there, maybe not everything we would need. Biggest issue; for each machine type, one row per lab, allows them to say more than one machine but only one serial number showing.Took a while to successfully import the data from the Nigeria Access Databases, solved it. Still working on initial data exploration, will update on next call.
4. When can we hope to obtain in-country data from Cameroon? 
5. When should I purchase and invoice a shinyapps.io account?
