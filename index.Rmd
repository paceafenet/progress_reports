# Nov 22 - Dec 1, 2018

## Progress Items

* Created a project GitHub account and associated repositories. Currently there are three repositories; one that will contain all eTool development code, another that will host a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) for progress, and a third repository that will host a GitHub page for the project's Final Report.
* Created associated RProject file for each repository and made templates that will be used to populate the GitHub pages referenced above.

## Agenda Items

* It is important that I store all code and progress reports using GitHub both for accountability and to facilitate reproduction of this project in the future. It is worth considering what should be kept in the repository. For example, the data I receive from Nigeria and Cameroon in country partners may include information we would not want to be accessible via GitHub.
