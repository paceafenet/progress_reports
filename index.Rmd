# Dec 3 - Dec 9, 2018

## Progress Items

* Reached out to Cameroon for in-country data
* Reached out to Mimi for clarification regarding invoicing procedures. Will await her response before upgrading current GitHub account to Developer version. 
* My plan is to use Google Sheets as the data source for the eTool, and use the eTool to edit the data in Google Sheets. I will use an approach similar to this [app](https://jennybc.shinyapps.io/10_read-write-private-sheet/) (code [here](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets/tree/master/inst/shiny-examples/10_read-write-private-sheet)). I have authenticated the project Google account using this approach and can access a toy data set I created in Google Sheets. 
* Added [Nigeria Data Report](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/existing_lab_data_exploration.md) to the project home page. A link to this report is included here and on the home page. A more aesthetically pleasing copy of the report has also been sent as an attachment ahead of this meeting. Full process and initial results contained in this report, major conclusions and questions resulting from these analyses included below in the agenda items.

## Agenda Items

1. Follow-up after initial exploration of Nigeria data.
* For more accurate location of lab equipment we would will need latitude and longitudes of labs, or at least more descriptive addresses. Geocoded existing addresses to limited success. 
* These data can be used for demonstration as they are now, but the eTool will be most useful with a complete inventory of equipment at each lab.
* Information initially identified as essential including calibration dates which could be used to identify when equipment is due for maintenance, calibration, or retirement is largely dependent on manufacturer specifications. From the data as it is currently, it would not be possible to identify when equipment should next be serviced. This point will require further discussion.

# Nov 22 - Dec 2, 2018

## Progress Items

* Created a project GitHub account and associated repositories. Currently there are three repositories; one that will contain all eTool development code, another that will host a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) for progress, and a third repository that will host a GitHub page for the project's [Final Report](https://paceafenet.github.io/final_report/).
* Created associated RProject file for each repository and made templates that will be used to populate the GitHub pages referenced above.
* Began writing the outline and portions of the Final Report page. This will be a living document that serves as a road map of how this project was completed.
* Reviewed possible scorecard metrics
* Reviewed Uganda VL Scorecard - sent brief proposal to Ruth, separate from eTool development.
* Began reviewing Nigeria data. 
* Created 'fake' equipment data should we be unable to obtain sufficient equipment data from the field.

## Agenda Items

1. It is important that I store all code and progress reports using GitHub both for accountability and to facilitate reproduction of this project in the future. It is worth considering what should be kept in the repository. For example, the data I receive from Nigeria and Cameroon in country partners may include information we would not want to be accessible in GitHub.
  * Comments on the GitHub Pages layout?
  * Thoughts on where to store in country data?
2. Lab-level Metrics for evaluation;
  * Equipment up time vs downtime
  * Avg number of equipment past due for repair or servicing
  * Elapsed time after past due 
  * What are acceptable levels for the above?
3. Nigeria Data: Quite a bit there, maybe not everything we would need. Biggest issue; for each machine type, one row per lab, allows them to say more than one machine but only one serial number showing.Took a while to successfully import the data from the Nigeria Access Databases, solved it. Still working on initial data exploration, will update on next call.
4. When can we hope to obtain in-country data from Cameroon? 
5. When should I purchase and invoice a shinyapps.io account?
