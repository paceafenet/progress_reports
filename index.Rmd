# Nov 22 - Dec 1, 2018

## Progress Items

* Created a project GitHub account and associated repositories. Currently there are three repositories; one that will contain all eTool development code, another that will host a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) for progress, and a third repository that will host a GitHub page for the project's Final Report.
* Created associated RProject file for each repository and made templates that will be used to populate the GitHub pages referenced above.
* Began writing the outline and portions of the Final Report page. This will be a living document that serves as a road map of how this project was completed.
* Reviewed possible scorecard metrics
* Reviewed Uganda VL Scorecard - sent brief proposal to Ruth, separate from eTool development. 

## Agenda Items

1. It is important that I store all code and progress reports using GitHub both for accountability and to facilitate reproduction of this project in the future. It is worth considering what should be kept in the repository. For example, the data I receive from Nigeria and Cameroon in country partners may include information we would not want to be accessible in GitHub.
  * Comments on the GitHub Pages layout?
  * Thoughts on where to store in country data?
2. Lab-level Metrics for evaluation;
  * Equipment up time vs downtime
  * Avg number of equipment past due for repair or servicing
  * Elapsed time after past due 
  * What are acceptable levels for the above?
3. When can we hope to obtain in-country data from Nigeria and Cameroon? (received - will review soon)
4. When should I purchase and invoice a shinyapps.io account?
