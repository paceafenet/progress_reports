# Dec 31, 2018 - Jan 6, 2019

## Progress Items
* Working on layout of eTool. Currently have a map, charts describing the current state of the data, as well as tables in a single layout. 
* Updated final report with additional libraries used in eTool development (DT and leaflet). 

## Agenda Items
1. Current state of invoice. Sent, 12/26, need feedback on format and payment to progress.
2. Discuss eTool current state. I have made significant progress, on the layout and functionality of the tool. I still need to add the ability to edit the data and have these changes captured in the app. However, the layout is coming along nicely.
If you are not accessing the meeting via a computer, here is a [link](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/screen%20grabs/eTool%20pic%20one%201_7_19.jpg) to a screen grab of the current layout.
3. See updates in the [Final Report](https://paceafenet.github.io/final_report/) for additional tools used during development.
4. Have reached out to Cameroon a few times, hoping to reconnect now that most people should be back from leave. 

# Dec 17 - Dec 30, 2018

## Progress Items

* During the Dec 18 call it was requested that in addition to the website version of the progress reports, I also make the report available as a pdf or word document if possible. It took a bit of figuring out, but I will now be asking Ruth to attach the most up to date version of the progress report as a pdf to each week's meeting invite as well as include the link to the progress report site. 
* Drafted and sent the first invoice for first five weeks of work.
* Finalized the Nigeria report. During the Dec 18 call it was also requested that I also summarize the service providers in the Nigerian assessment data. Note to Travis: Go to the [report](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/existing_lab_data_exploration.md) and summarize this additional table. 
* Began developing eTool application code based on fake data set. 

## Agenda Items
1. Discuss eTool layout. So far working on the map to show what labs need attention (discuss criteria), general layout scheme developed.
2. Discuss Nigeria report updates.

# Dec 3 - Dec 16, 2018

## Progress Items

* Reached out to Cameroon for in-country data
* Reached out to Mimi for clarification regarding invoicing procedures. Will await her response before upgrading current GitHub account to Developer version. 
* My plan is to use Google Sheets as the data source for the eTool, and use the eTool to edit the data in Google Sheets. I will use an approach similar to this [app](https://jennybc.shinyapps.io/10_read-write-private-sheet/) (code [here](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets/tree/master/inst/shiny-examples/10_read-write-private-sheet)). I have authenticated the project Google account using this approach and can access a toy data set I created in Google Sheets. 
* Added [Nigeria Data Report](https://github.com/paceafenet/etool_dev/blob/master/existing_lab_data_exploration.md) to the project home page. A link to this report is included here and on the home page. A more aesthetically pleasing copy of the report has also been sent as an attachment ahead of this meeting. Full process and initial results contained in this report, major conclusions and questions resulting from these analyses included below in the agenda items.

## Agenda Items

1. Follow-up after initial exploration of Nigeria data.
* For more accurate location of lab equipment we would will need latitude and longitudes of labs, or at least more descriptive addresses. Geocoded existing addresses to limited success. 
* These data can be used for demonstration as they are now, but the eTool will be most useful with a complete inventory of equipment at each lab.
* Information initially identified as essential including calibration dates which could be used to identify when equipment is due for maintenance, calibration, or retirement is largely dependent on manufacturer specifications. From the data as it is currently, it would not be possible to identify when equipment should next be serviced. This point will require further discussion.

# Nov 22 - Dec 2, 2018

## Progress Items

* Created a project GitHub account and associated repositories. Currently there are three repositories; one that will contain all eTool development code, another that will host a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) for progress, and a third repository that will host a GitHub page for the project's [Final Report](https://paceafenet.github.io/final_report/).
* Created associated RProject file for each repository and made templates that will be used to populate the GitHub pages referenced above.
* Began writing the outline and portions of the Final Report page. This will be a living document that serves as a road map of how this project was completed.
* Reviewed possible scorecard metrics
* Reviewed Uganda VL Scorecard - sent brief proposal to Ruth, separate from eTool development.
* Began reviewing Nigeria data. 
* Created 'fake' equipment data should we be unable to obtain sufficient equipment data from the field.

## Agenda Items

1. It is important that I store all code and progress reports using GitHub both for accountability and to facilitate reproduction of this project in the future. It is worth considering what should be kept in the repository. For example, the data I receive from Nigeria and Cameroon in country partners may include information we would not want to be accessible in GitHub.
  * Comments on the GitHub Pages layout?
  * Thoughts on where to store in country data?
2. Lab-level Metrics for evaluation;
  * Equipment up time vs downtime
  * Avg number of equipment past due for repair or servicing
  * Elapsed time after past due 
  * What are acceptable levels for the above?
3. Nigeria Data: Quite a bit there, maybe not everything we would need. Biggest issue; for each machine type, one row per lab, allows them to say more than one machine but only one serial number showing.Took a while to successfully import the data from the Nigeria Access Databases, solved it. Still working on initial data exploration, will update on next call.
4. When can we hope to obtain in-country data from Cameroon? 
5. When should I purchase and invoice a shinyapps.io account?
